### REQUIREMENT
Add column NetBuySell to MPS_Company table
- NetBuySell bit NOT NULL

Update data:
``` sql
update MPS_Company Set [NetBuySell] = 1 where [Company_Name] = 'NGX'
update MPS_Company Set [NetBuySell] = 0 where [Company_Name] != 'NGX'
```


Check NetBuySell both Company and CounterParty to set value for **NettingTreatment**

**NettingTreatment = FALSE**
Keep the calculation
Identify Buyer and Seller of each record with condition
```
If (BuySell) = 'Buy', Buyer = (Company_Anct_Name) and Seller = (Counterparty_Anct_Name)
If (BuySell) = 'Sell', Buyer = (Counterparty_Anct_Name) and Seller = (Company_Anct_Name)
```


**NettingTreatment = TRUE**

```
Scheduled_MW = HedgeMW

Sum(Scheduled_MW) - grouping the records by - Company, CounterParty,  Date, HourEnding, SettlementPoint

Sum(Scheduled_MW) >= 0, Buyer = Company, Seller = CounterParty
Sum(Scheduled_MW) < 0, Buyer = CounterParty, Seller = Company
```
