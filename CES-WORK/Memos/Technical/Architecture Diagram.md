Do you often encounter the following situations when you are drawing architecture diagrams:
- You are good at writing code, but you don't know how to deal with canvas
- You don't know what should be drawn or omitted in the system
- The layout is messy. You are not satisfied with how to adjust it.
- Hard to approach new concept from Technical Architect
- How to control the complexity of new concept apply to the Software System


## Business architecture diagrams
In order to draw a good business architecture diagram, you must fully understand the business process, analyze the relationship between business from the perspective of business, identify the business attributes of each process through your understanding of business, and then abstract hierarchically to finally achieve a closed loop of product functions.

## System architecture diagram
The system architecture diagram is drawn for software developers, so this architecture diagram is completely different from the above busniess architecture diagram. We need to tell them how to design our system through a diagram. The specific needs are as follows:
- It is necessary to clearly describe how many modules are in the system, the responsibilities of each module, and where the boundaries of each module
- The relationship between modules and how they communicate
- How to transfer data between modules.

Architecture is a very abstract thing. It takes a long time to understand architecture. It is more difficult to draw the system architecture through your own understanding.
