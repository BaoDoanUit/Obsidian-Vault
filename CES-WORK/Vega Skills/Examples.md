## Strengths

Over the past year, I've noticed that my problem-solving skills have significantly improved. I've become more adept at breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks. This has not only increased my efficiency but also made the process of coding more enjoyable.

I've also become more comfortable with pair programming and code reviews. Initially, I was hesitant to share my code and accept feedback from others. However, I've come to realize that this collaborative approach has greatly improved the quality of my code and accelerated my learning.

## Areas for Improvement

Despite these improvements, there are still areas where I need to grow. For instance, I've noticed that I tend to rush into coding without spending enough time planning and designing the software. This often leads to code that is harder to maintain and debug. Going forward, I will dedicate more time to software design before jumping into coding.

I also need to improve my knowledge of data structures and algorithms. While I have a basic understanding of these topics, I often find myself struggling with more complex algorithmic problems. To address this, I plan to dedicate a few hours each week to studying and practicing these concepts.

## Goals for the Next Year

In the coming year, I aim to become more proficient in Python and JavaScript, as these are the primary languages used in my current project. I also plan to learn a new language, possibly Rust or Go, to broaden my skill set.

Another goal is to contribute to open-source projects. This will not only improve my coding skills but also help me become a part of the larger developer community.

Lastly, I aim to read at least one technical book per month. This will help me stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in the software industry.

In conclusion, while I'm proud of the progress I've made, I realize that there's always room for improvement. I'm excited about the learning opportunities that lie ahead and am committed to becoming a better software engineer.




# Self-Reflection

## Strengths

Over the past year, I've made significant strides in my understanding and application of .NET technologies. I've become proficient in using C# for backend development and have gained a solid understanding of ASP.NET MVC for creating robust and scalable web applications.

I've also improved my ability to work with databases, particularly with Entity Framework, which has allowed me to efficiently interact with SQL Server databases in my projects.

My debugging skills have also improved, thanks to my regular use of Visual Studio's debugging tools. This has helped me to quickly identify and fix issues in my code, thereby improving the overall quality of my work.

## Areas for Improvement

Despite these strengths, there are areas where I need to improve. For instance, I've noticed that I need to enhance my understanding of .NET Core and .NET 5. These are becoming increasingly popular, and having a strong grasp of these technologies will be crucial for my future projects.

I also need to work on my front-end skills. While I'm comfortable with backend development, I've found that I struggle with front-end technologies like JavaScript, CSS, and Angular. Improving these skills will allow me to become a more well-rounded .NET developer.

## Goals for the Next Year

In the coming year, I aim to become more proficient in .NET Core and .NET 5. I plan to dedicate a few hours each week to learning these technologies, using online resources and practical projects.

I also aim to improve my front-end skills. I plan to take an online course on Angular and practice building front-end applications using this framework.

Another goal is to contribute to .NET open-source projects. This will not only help me improve my coding skills but also give me a chance to give back to the .NET community.

In conclusion, while I'm proud of the progress I've made as a .NET developer, I realize that there's always room for improvement. I'm excited about the learning opportunities that lie ahead and am committed to becoming a better software engineer.
