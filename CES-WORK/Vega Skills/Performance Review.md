- [ ] A - Achievements
Describe your achievements over the last year. List your achievements and provide a brief description.
Over the past year, I've noticed that my problem-solving skills have significantly improved. I've become more adept at breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks. This has not only increased my efficiency but also made the process of coding more enjoyable.

I've also become more comfortable with pair programming and code reviews. Initially, I was hesitant to share my code and accept feedback from others. However, I've come to realize that this collaborative approach has greatly improved the quality of my code and accelerated my learning.

- [ ] B - Associates Assisted with Achievements
Are there any Associates who were of particular help in your achievements this year? If so how did you learn from them or how did their skills contribute to the achievement?

Yes, there were a few associates who played a crucial role in my achievements this year.

One of them is Rohit. He has a deep understanding of .NET technologies. I often found myself studying his code to understand how he solves complex problems. His ability to write maintainable and scalable code has been a great learning experience for me.

Another associate who has been of great help is Khai, a software engineer. Khai has a knack for debugging and problem-solving. Whenever I was stuck with a bug or a challenging problem, Alex was always ready to help. His analytical skills and patience in dealing with complex issues have greatly contributed to my growth as a software engineer.

Lastly, Tam and Carla were extremely helpful in clarifying complex business requirements and explaining EDI tickets in detail.

In conclusion, I believe that learning from others is a crucial part of personal development. I’m grateful to have such skilled and supportive associates who have contributed to my achievements this year. I look forward to learning more from them in the future.

- [ ] C - Obstacles/Challenges
List any obstacles/challenges (if any) preventing greater success.
Despite these improvements, there are still areas where I need to grow. For instance, I've noticed that I tend to rush into coding without spending enough time planning and designing the software. This often leads to code that is harder to maintain. Going forward, I will dedicate more time to software design before jumping into coding.


- [ ] D - Personal Weaknesses
Describe any weaknesses and skills that you could work on to improve upon them?

I’m not confident in my ability to handle issues that arise after I complete a task.

There are some ways to improve it.
1. Identify the root cause of the issue: It’s important to understand why you’re having trouble controlling issues after finishing a task.
2. Break tasks into smaller pieces: This can help me focus on one thing at a time and make it easier to control issues as they arise.
3. Prioritize tasks: Prioritizing tasks can help me stay focused and avoid getting sidetracked.
4. Take breaks: Taking breaks can help me stay focused and avoid burnout. 
5. Learn from your mistakes:Try to learn from it and use it as an opportunity to improve.
