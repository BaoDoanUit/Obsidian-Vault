### Skill definition
There will be times where you either are stuck or you are not sure if it is safe or appropriate to take action. When you're uncertain or making little progress, you should pull in help proactively.

You can think of our team as a ship at sea. If you accidentally blow a hole in the side of our ship above the waterline, then no big deal. If you blow a hole below the waterline, we all sink! Any time you think holes might be appearing below the waterline, you should seek the help of others, or simply escalate.

### Fluency in this skill typically includes:
Self-evaluating if you are stuck and not just spinning or wasting time.
Learning where the waterline is in your role.
Self-evaluating if you're going to take an action that is below the waterline.
Identifying the right colleague to reach out to depending on the type of escalation.
Proactively and assertively reaching out to leaders, coaches, or experts to help you make progress without wasting time.

### Aspects of someone who is still learning this skill:
They let themselves get stuck and end up wasting precious time.
They take big risks that could hurt the whole team or our customers.
They aren't proactive or aggressive when trying to find help to get unstuck.
They escalate too much (i.e., they escalate decisions that are above their waterline).
Fluency in this skill typically requires knowledge of:
Policies with regards to your work.
Escalation processes (if they exist).
Personal relationships with the experts who could help you with your work
