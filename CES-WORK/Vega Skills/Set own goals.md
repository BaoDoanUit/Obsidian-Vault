### Setting goals can be a great way to help you achieve what you want in life, work, and mindfulness. Here are some tips to help you get started:

##### Reflect on your values and priorities. What is important to you? What do you want to achieve in life? What are your long-term goals?
1. Advance my work

Make your goals SMART. SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. This means that your goals should be clear, quantifiable, realistic, relevant to your values and priorities, and have a deadline.

Example:
Specific: I want to learn new things (EF Core).
Measurable: I will complete an advanced-level course on the EF Core within the next 1 month.
Achievable: I will dedicate 1 hour per day to studying the programming language and complete all assignments on time.
Relevant: Learning new things (EF Core) will help me advance in my career as a software developer.
Time-bound: I will complete the course and be able to apply the new concept of EF Core to the current project by November 10, 2023.

Break down your goals into smaller steps. This can help you stay motivated and make progress towards your goals.

Example:
Start with the basics: Before diving into EF Core, it’s essential to have a good understanding of C# and .NET Core.
Practice with sample projects: Once you have a good understanding of the basics, it’s time to start practicing with sample projects. I can find many tutorials and sample projects online, such as the Complete Entity Framework Core Tutorial or Learn Entity Framework Core.
Join the community: Joining the EF Core community can be an excellent way to learn from others and get help when you need it. You can join the official EF Core GitHub repository or participate in forums like Stack Overflow.

Track progress. Record what you have accomplished so far and what you still need to do.
Example:
Set clear goals: Before you start learning, it’s essential to set clear goals for yourself.
Create a learning plan: Once you have set your goals, it’s time to create a learning plan.
Track progress: I use Google Calendar to add block time to study new things. (I update this every week) It depends on my work in the week.

Stay flexible. Be open to changing your goals if they are no longer relevant.

2. Advance my life and mindfulness

Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness is being present and aware of your thoughts, feelings, and surroundings. You can practice mindfulness by meditating, focusing on breathing, or simply being in the moment.
Example: Spend at least 30 minutes/day practicing mindfulness and write down anything after practicing mindfulness.

Set clear goals: Setting clear goals can help you stay motivated and focused on your personal growth and development. Always listen to myself and what needs to improve every day.

Create a plan: Once you have set your goals, it’s essential to create a plan that works for you. Create a plan for the short-term and long-term every day.

Track progress: Record what you have accomplished so far and what you still need to do. Write down the result review it every week and make an adjustment appropriate.
