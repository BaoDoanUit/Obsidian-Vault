## General
While your environment has a material effect on your tomo (i.e., your mindset to perform), with practice, you can develop the skill to be resilient to your environment. This skill is about taking the steps needed to diagnose your own tomo and keep it as high as possible.

Remember, tomo is an encapsulation of why you are doing an activity. You are high-tomo if you are doing any given aspect of your job for play (i.e., love of the work), purpose (i.e., belief in the impact of your work), potential (i.e., the work is helping you grow), and NOT emotional pressure (e.g., you are pleasing your boss or colleagues), economic pressure (e.g., you're seeking a reward or avoiding a punishment), or inertia (e.g., you don't know why you're doing the work).

It is because of this skill that some superstar athletes seem to be immune to the emotional pressure and economic pressure of a big game.

#### Fluency in this skill typically includes:
When you're stuck, you create an "ugly first draft" and share it with colleagues so that action beats your emotional pressure.
You are excited to learn from others, and seek out mentors and teachers.
You are excited to learn new skills. Your skills map and the skill catalog look like a all-you-can-eat buffets of tasty foods!
You are quick to point out where your work didn't achieve its expected outcome. Better still, you share what you've learned.
You are generous in helping your colleagues also feel tomo by building them up.

#### Aspects of someone who is still learning this skill:
Defensiveness: they are trying to justify themselves rather than learning.
Tentativeness: they are tentative to take the first step because they are afraid of failing. Unfortunately, taking the first step (even if it is corrected) is the best way to learn.
Anger: they allow their emotional pressure (i.e., feeling insecure or anxious) result in anger or disengagement.
Trying to game the system: they are cheating on learning skills, which will hurt them and their colleagues in the long run.
Focusing on getting exposure versus doing the work for the customer.
Trying to find blame, as in blaming their leaders or colleagues.
Unwilling to learn from others.
Avoiding work with uncertainty or higher likelihood of failure.
Seeking certain work items because they are highly visible and easy.

### Notes:
We've all been there—feeling judged and insecure, and feeling like you have to get your leaders to like you. You start solving for that, and not the work, which only digs your hole deeper. Trust me, I know. The thing that is really tough about this skill is that people who are struggling with their tomo are typically unwilling to admit it. And it is really uncomfortable to bring it up with your friends, leaders, and coaches. My biggest tip to you - make it easy for your colleagues to point out that you're struggling with this skill so that you can get help and see your blind spot.
