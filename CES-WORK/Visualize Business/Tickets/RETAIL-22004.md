# Text Elements
Currently permission settings do not allow for restricting 
access to just the statement/invoice tab. The client is looking 
for further permission that will allow them to restrict access 
to that tab, but still give users access to remaining billing 
functionality. ^eVwus5h5

As a CES BLUE client, users should have access to functionality 
with the Dual Billing section but also be able to assign certain 
users which should have access to the Statement/Invoice screen 
while restricting others from having access. ^vhLBqlhy

Add option to CES BLUE > Billing > Billing Admin for Admin 
to configure permissions for users to have access to the 
“Statement/Invoice” screen from the Billing Dual list. ^glJkowyI

Expectation is that only the “Access” checkbox would be available for 
the “Statement/Invoice” option as currently there is no permission 
available to edit different parts of the “Statement/Invoice” screen.   
If desire is to have both read-only and read-update access, that may 
need to be addressed as a separate ticket.

 ^IhelfLwM

Modify the CES BLUE > Billing > Dual Billing screen so that 
ONLY users who have permissions to the “Statement/Invoice” 
screen are able to see the corresponding tab. ^PpjrDXJ0

Logic within the “Statement/Invoice” screen should remain the same. ^0NKuPfZ2

Users who do not have Statement/Invoice option checked under the 
Billing Admin screen but have other options enabled should be able 
to see the other tabs under the Dual Billing section but NOT the 
“Statement/Invoice” screen. ^3BKmhU6m

Users should be able to place a “check” on the “Statement/Invoice” 
box and save options. ^r0N9v4ko
