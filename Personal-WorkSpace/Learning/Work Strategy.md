## Agile Methodology
Theory vs Practice
Agile is iterative, Waterfall is sequential
Agile is lean, Waterfall is heavy
Agile is fast, Waterfall is slow
Agile is code-first, Waterfall is doc-first

- Sprint Planning - as simple as it seems, a long session (up to 4 hours) to plan items/user stories that need to be delivered during the following sprint, involving the scrum team.
- Daily stand-up meetings - a daily, SHORT, meeting (around 15 minutes) where the small development team (like 3 to 7 people), communicates their progress and underlines blocking issues, both without going into deep detail.
- Sprint Execution - People autonomously pulling tasks, then execute them and solve eventual issues through informal meetings, pair-programming sessions, code reviews.
- Sprint Review - a long meeting (between 1-2 hours) which aim is showcasing the sprint outcome to stakeholders and getting feedback from them.
- Sprint Retrospective - an internal analysis of what has been executed, with focus on impediments, in order to remove them for future sprints and overall continously improve processes, practices and tooling for the next iteration.
- Back Refinement - not really a ceremony but roughly 10% of the time that should be spent by the team, during a sprint, on backlog refinement to: break down, explain, find gaps, provide a definition of done and collaboratively prioritize the tasks.


Scrum is often seen by mangement as an elixir of productivity and cure for any under-performing team, but reality is pretty much the opposite
Scrum does not solve your team performance issues
Way of work should be defined at a team level by its people, not by company


The fix 
- Take the retrospective seriously, as a moment to reflect with a clear mind, over what turned out to be a good strategy, how to iterate on that and praise the team for the job done.
- Ask for advice
- Trust the team
- Be aware that metrics will lie at some point
- Encourage mistakes
