Think about what you need to do next step?
Always keep your target|goal in your mind when you wanna get it.
Should be stable anything you do.
Practice take notes by English instead Vietnamese
That's ok if we keep it like that.

### Write EVERYTHING Down
You wont forget any steps, especially in larger tasks.
You will be able to look back at your workflow and reflect on where you can improve.
No need to bother your supervisor with questions they already answered.
You'll have boilerplate to-do list for similar tasks in the future.
One of the most valuable things a team lead can have is the ability to Fire-and-forget tasks, which means having the full confidence that the developer will handle a task thoroughly end-to-end without further intervention. The only way to achieve this by documenting!

### Have a Positive Mindset
Sometimes, attitude is even more important than professional knowledge. When we experience a severe bug, instead of getting mad, our team lead always says "we learned a lot from this" - There is nothing more inspiring than this mutual growth mindset.
Get used to seeing every challenge as an opportunity. There will always be annoying tasks, but ussally those are the ones we learn the most from.

### No Ego
I cannot stress enough the importance of this one. One of the greatest ways to learn is by getting feedback on your code through code reviews. This is where ego plays a huge part. Be open to criticism and remember that even younger or less experienced developers can teach you something new.
Always Keep Learning
