### Summary
Purpose of this document is provide all information processes related to local (server)
1. Process generate code
2. Optimize all resources



### Business

### Generate data for testing purpose
- The idea behind partition data for testing behavior of process.
- Focus on behaviors frequently regression test.
- Next step 


### Input data for source data
- Pick up data from current state -> input into **local storage**
- QA can provide input data (source) - parallel execution (.csv file) for each table to test
- Better should be prepare the mockup data for each scenario
- Function to delete all things after finish testing
- Keep the name of db with release-version (base on the change of behavior)  
- Input data follow scenarios - Make it easy for testing


### Execute process
- Run process with **local storage** independence

### Verify data in destination (tables, csv files)
- Define a dataset result output  in **local storage** run independencies can switch to another database use for both purposes
- Keep the value of output
