Microservices architecture is a method that allows large teams to build scalable applications composed of many loosely coupled services, each handling a dedicated function. These services communicate via well-defined interfaces and can be independently deployed and scaled.

Key components of this architecture include an API gateway, which handles incoming requests and routes them to the relevant microservices, and a service registry and discovery service, which helps locate the services. Other components include monitoring and alerting systems, and DevOps tooling for deployment and troubleshooting.

However, implementing microservices architecture comes with challenges. One major drawback is the breaking up of a monolithic database into separate logical units, shifting the burden of maintaining data integrity to the application layer.

Microservices architecture is beneficial for large teams as it enables team independence, allowing each domain to be independently maintained by a dedicated team. However, due to the overhead of implementation, it may not be a good fit for small startups. Itâ€™s advised for startups to design each function in the application with a well-defined interface, making it easier to migrate to a microservices architecture if necessary in the future.


## Plan Monolithic to Microservices
Sure, here's a detailed plan to transform a monolithic application to a microservices architecture while dealing with a relational database:
- **Understand the Domain**: Before you start, it's important to have a good understanding of the problem space. Understand the natural boundaries in the domain that provide the right level of isolation.
- **Identify Microservice Candidates**: Start by identifying the parts of your monolith that can be isolated into separate services. These should be self-sufficient and deployable functional entities grouped by a purpose.
- **Decouple by Domain-Driven Design**: To decouple capabilities from a monolith, you have to carefully extract the capability's data, logic, and user-facing components, and redirect them to the new service.
- **Prioritize Services for Migration**: Avoid refactoring everything all at once. Evaluate the cost of decoupling against the benefits that you get. Services in a microservice architecture are organized around business concerns, not technical concerns.
- **Extract a Service from a Monolith**: When you incrementally migrate services, configure communication between services and monolith to go through well-defined API contracts.
- **Manage a Monolithic Database**: One of the principles of a microservices architecture is to have one database for each microservice. Therefore, when you modernize your monolithic application into microservices, you must also consider how to handle your database. You can start by separating its data to its own tables.
- **Automate**: Microservices require much more automation. Think in advance about continuous integration (CI), continuous deployment (CD), central logging, and monitoring.
- **Test**: Ensure that each microservice works as expected and that they work together as a system.
- **Monitor Your Microservices**: Use tools like Azure Monitor and Azure Application Insights to provide comprehensive runtime telemetry and analysis of your microservices in the cloud.
