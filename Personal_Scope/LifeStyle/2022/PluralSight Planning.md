Event Bus with RabbitMQ Message Broker Service
- Async Microservices Communication with **RabbitMQ Message-Broker Service**
- Using **RabbitMQ Publish/Subcribe Topic Exchange Model**
- Using **MassTransit** for abstraction over RabbitMQ Message-Broker system
- Publishing BasketCheckout event queue from Basket microservices and Subcribing this event from Ordering microservices
- Create RabbitMQ EventBus.Messages Common Class Library and add references Microservices
- Containerize RabbitMQ Message Queue system with Basket and Ordering microservice using Docker Compose.

### Sending and Receiving Message with RabbitMQ

### Set up gRPC with RabbitMQ

### Deployment
The deployment of message queue relative simple, but it should be noted that for the convenience of my own deployment for temporary demonstration, It did not map the persistent data and configuration files of Redis and RabbitMQ, which is very not recommended. Stateful services should be deployed and data should not be stored.
