A code quality culture is essential to stay ahead of your competition. High code quality ensures your codebase is maintainable, scalable, and efficient. While a culture of code quality is an internal aspect of your engineering team, it directly affects your end users. High-quality code allows you to ship new features faster, improving the user experience.

CTOs and engineering managers need to establish agreed styles and standards to build a culture of code quality. They should also track high-quality issues, be awesome at code reviews, track code qual

Problem Solving
Use the power of group to advise and evaluate the best solution for your problem. This is especially effective when you are in the early stages of a new design or planning to refactor for new functionality.

Challenge: Intimate understanding of the problem is needed to find subtle issues within the solution. Pick your patner wisely.


Defect finding 
Now that an approrite solution path has been chosen and the first lines of code have been writen, it's time to pause and see if you can discover bugs and defects in the solution. The solution is reviewed to ensure the overal factoring makes sense , the right abstractions were chosen and core algorithms can perform what is needed.

Challenge: Deep domain knowledge and understandign of the problem space are needed to discover subtle defects, bugs, and other quality-related issues

Readability - Skip 
When working on smaller features or stable code bases
- Feature small, localized changes (the bulk of a change should usually be in one file/class)
- Short-lived branches (1-3 days max)
- 90% of reviews should not need more than two reviewer (most should do with one)
- Pair program with someone who is a qualified reviewer for the code so your code is reviewed as you go along
- Learn into in-person reviews where the reviewee can walk the reviewer through the code and the reviewer can ask questions online
- During the review, focus on education, readability, maintainability, and accident prevention.
