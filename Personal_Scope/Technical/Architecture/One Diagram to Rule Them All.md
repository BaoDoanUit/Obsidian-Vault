## The Why: Visuals Will..
### Stick in Long-Term Memory
Words are processed by short-term memory, images go directly to long-term memory
### Transmit Message Faster 
Humans process visual information more effeciently than text
### Improve Comprehension
Our brains are wired to automatically interpret relationships and patterns between objects
### Trigger Emotions
Visual memory is encoded in same part of brain where emotions are processed.

## The How: Choose the right diagram

## The How: Follow the Standards
#### Color
Pick a good color scheme, and stick to it
- They should constrast enough
- Complimentary colors
- Limited set, don't use too many.
#### Font
Choose an appropriate font for diagram type
- Sans-serif better for tech diagrams
- Use only one font
#### Lines
Use consistent line types with appropriate font for diagram type.
- Balance line weight with font weight
- Use different line types (dashed, double, etc) to express different things
#### Whitespace
Appropriate amount of whitespace to express relationships
- Too much makes relationships unclear
- Too little make things look cluttered
#### Alignment
Always try to align objects horizontally and vertically
- Viewer's eye will pick up that something is "not right" if not aligned
- Leverage alignment tooling

## The How: KISS
Keep It Simple, Stupid
#### Viewable on one screen
- Avoid making it too big
- Ideally the viewer can see the whole thing at once without squinting.
#### Make a separate diagram if more detail needed
- If more details would be helpful but out of scope,  create a separate "zoomed in" digaram.
#### Use a few objects as possible
- Determine your scope. 
- Try not to clutter the view with too many objects that overwhelm the viewer and aren't necessary to the scope.
